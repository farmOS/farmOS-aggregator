farmOS-aggregator is an application for interacting with multiple [farmOS](https://farmOS.org)
instances. The application provides a GUI for registering farmOS instances with the Aggregator
and a REST API for interacting with farmOS instances. Depending on how an Aggregator is configured,
farmOS admins will authorize access to only a subset of their farm's data.

farmOS-aggregator is built with:
* [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) for the REST API
* [farmOS.py](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS.py) client library for querying farmOS instances
