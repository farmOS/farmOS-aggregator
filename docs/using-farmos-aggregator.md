## Dashboard

![Dashboard](../img/ui/aggregator_dashboard.png)

A dashboard with an overview of information is available at [http://localhost/dashboard](http://localhost/dashboard)

Features:
- Displays simple stats showing the total number of farms, active farms, and authorized farms. Useful to quickly see if
any farms have become unauthorized.

## Managing Farm Profiles

![Farm Profiles](../img/ui/manage_farms.png)

Features:
- Lists all farm profiles in a sortable table.
- Sorts by the farm `active` flag.
- Displays the `authorization` status of the farm.
    - Hover over the `re-authorize` button to see the error.
    - Click on the `authorized` button to see more info on the __ page.
- Displays `tags` that can be used to categorize farms.
- Displays `last_accessed` and `created` times.
- Button to `edit` the farm profile - see edit farms.
- Button to quickly refresh `farm info`. This is useful to diagnose connection problems.

### Add Farms

![Add Farm](../img/ui/add_farm.png)

Features:
- Add a farm profile to the aggregator. _Note that you can only pre-populate values for the farm._ **_After you add a farm via the admin UI, you will not be able to connect to the farm._**
- After adding, the farm must be `authorized` by requesting authorization from the farmOS server admin.
- The `active` flag can be configured when adding a farm.

#### Registering Farm Profiles

![Register Farm Profiles](../img/ui/register_step2.png)

The registration page allows farmOS admins to select for which of the configured OAuth scopes they would like to
authorize the farmOS Aggregator to access their data.

Features:
- If `OPEN_FARM_REGISTRATION` is enabled then this page will be accessible to the public. The 
`FARM_ACTIVE_AFTER_REGISTRATION` setting allows you to configure if registered farms will be enabled by default. This
can be useful to guard against malicious intent if many farm profiles are added.
- If `INVITE_FARM_REGISTRATION` is enabled then this page will be accessible to users that receive a link with an
embedded `api_token`. See _[Requesting Registration](#requesting-registration)_
- The registration is a multi step process (step 2 is show above):
  1) User inputs farmOS Server Hostname.
  2) User selects which of the configured OAuth Scopes they want to authorize.
  3) The user is redirected to their farmOS server to complete the OAuth Authorization Flow.
  4) Basic farm values are pre-populated in the registration form. The user verifies their information.

#### Requesting Registration

![Request Registration](../img/ui/request_registration.png)

Features:
- Aggregator admins can _request registration_ by generating a special link users can use to join the aggregator.
    - An email can be supplied to automatically send an email requesting registration, OR
    - The link can be generated and copy/pasted to share with the user manually.

### Authorizing Farm Profiles

Authorization is a crucial part of the farmOS Aggregator. Because farmOS server `usernames` and `passwords` are not 
saved in the database, access to farmOS servers must be _authorized_ via the OAuth2 Authorization protocol. There are a
few instances when authorization may be required of users:
- After manually adding a farm via the admin UI
- If communication with the farmOS server is ever broken for an extended amount of time, the existing authorization could
expire. The server must then be _re-authorized_.
- If the Aggregator ever wants to request that users authorize with new or additional OAuth Scopes, then admins must 
request users to _re-authorize_ with those additional scopes.


#### Requesting Authorization

![Request Authorization](../img/ui/request_authorization.png)

Features:
- Aggregator admins can _request authorization_ of a farmOS server by generating a special link users can use to
authorize their farmOS server. **_This link is unique to each individual farm profile. It should only be shared with
the owner of that farmOS server._**
    - An email address can be supplied to automatically send an email to the farmOS admin. (This will default to the email
saved in the farm profile, if applicable.)
    - The link can also be generated and copy/pasted to share with the user manually.

#### Authorization Form

![Re-Authorize](../img/ui/re-authorize.png)

This is the form that users are directed to by the generated authorization links.

- Authorization is a 3 step process:
  1) User selects which of the configured OAuth Scopes they want to authorize.
  2) The user is redirected to their farmOS server to complete the OAuth Authorization Flow.
  3) The user is redirected to the Aggregator showing that the authorization was successful.
